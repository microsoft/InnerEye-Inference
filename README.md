# Introduction

InnerEye-Inference is an App Service webapp in python to run inference on medical imaging models trained with the [InnerEye-DeepLearning toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-Inference).

You can also integrate this with DICOM using the [InnerEye-Gateway](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-Gateway).

## Getting Started

### Operating System

If developing or using this tool locally, we highly recommend using [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) as your operating system. This is as the Azure App Service base image will be Ubuntu. By developing locally in Ubuntu you can guarantee maximum repeatibility between local and cloud behaviour.

For windows users this is easily done through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Installing Conda or Miniconda

Download a Conda or Miniconda [installer for your platform](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
and run it.

### Creating a Conda environment

Note that in order to create the Conda environment you will need to have build tools installed on your machine. If you are running Windows, they should be already installed with Conda distribution.

You can install build tools on Ubuntu (and Debian-based distributions) by running:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

If you are running CentOS/RHEL distributions, you can install the build tools by running:

```shell
yum install gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel make
```

Start the `conda` prompt for your platform. In that prompt, navigate to your repository root and run:

```console
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate inference
```

### Configuration

Add this script with name set_environment.sh to set your env variables. This can be executed in Linux. The code will read the file if the environment variables are not present.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export CUSTOMCONNSTR_AZUREML_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET=
export CUSTOMCONNSTR_API_AUTH_SECRET=
export CLUSTER=
export WORKSPACE_NAME=
export EXPERIMENT_NAME=
export RESOURCE_GROUP=
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
export APPLICATION_ID=
export TENANT_ID=
export DATASTORE_NAME=
export IMAGE_DATA_FOLDER=
```

Run with `source set_environment.sh`

### Running flask app locally

- `flask run` to test it locally

### Testing flask app locally

The app can be tested locally using [`curl`](https://curl.se/).

#### Ping

To check that the server is running, issue this command from a local shell:

```console
curl -i -H "API_AUTH_SECRET: <val of CUSTOMCONNSTR_API_AUTH_SECRET>" http://localhost:5000/v1/ping
```

This should produce an output similar to:

```text
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.3
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 2021 11:50:20 GMT
```

#### Start

To test DICOM image segmentation of a file, first create `Tests/TestData/HN.zip` containing a zipped set of the test DICOM files in `Tests/TestData/HN`. Then assuming there is a model `PassThroughModel:4`, issue this command:

```text
curl -i \
    -X POST \
    -H "API_AUTH_SECRET: <val of CUSTOMCONNSTR_API_AUTH_SECRET>" \
    --data-binary @Tests/TestData/HN.zip \
    http://localhost:5000/v1/model/start/PassThroughModel:4
```

This should produce an output similar to:

```text
HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 33
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.3
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:13 GMT

api_inference_1629291609_fb5dfdf9
```

here `api_inference_1629291609_fb5dfdf9` is the run id for the newly submitted inference job.

#### Results

To monitor the progress of the previously submitted inference job, issue this command:

```console
curl -i \
    -H "API_AUTH_SECRET: <val of CUSTOMCONNSTR_API_AUTH_SECRET>" \
    --head \
    http://localhost:5000/v1/model/results/api_inference_1629291609_fb5dfdf9 \
    --next \
    -H "API_AUTH_SECRET: <val of CUSTOMCONNSTR_API_AUTH_SECRET>" \
    --output "HN_rt.zip" \
    http://localhost:5000/v1/model/results/api_inference_1629291609_fb5dfdf9
```

If the run is still in progress then this should produce output similar to:

```text
HTTP/1.0 202 ACCEPTED
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.3
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:45:20 GMT

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:--     0
```

If the run is complete then this should produce an output similar to:

```text
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: 131202
Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/3.7.3
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:01:27 GMT

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  128k  100  128k    0     0   150k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  150k
```

and download the inference result as a zipped DICOM-RT file to `HN_rt.zip`.

### Running flask app in Azure

1. Install Azure CLI: `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash`
2. Login: `az login --use-device-code`
3. Deploy: `az webapp up --sku S1 --name test-python12345 --subscription <your_subscription_name> -g InnerEyeInference --location <your region> --runtime PYTHON:3.7`
4. In the Azure portal go to Monitoring > Log Stream for debugging logs

### Deployment build

If you would like to reproduce the automatic deployment of the service for testing purposes:

- `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<name>" --role contributor --scope /subscriptions/<subs>/resourceGroups/InnerEyeInference --sdk-auth`
- The previous command will return a json object with the content for the variable `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` .github/workflows/deploy.yml

## Images

During inference the image data zip file is copied to the IMAGE_DATA_FOLDER in the AzureML workspace's DATASTORE_NAME datastore. At the end of inference the copied image data zip file is overwritten with a simple line of text. At present we cannot delete these. If you would like these overwritten files removed from your datastore you can [add a policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal) to delete items from the datastore after a period of time. We recommend 7 days.

## Changing Dependencies

The Azure App Service will use the packages specified in `requirements.txt` to create the python virtual environment in which the flask app is run. The `environment.yml` is used for local environments only. Therefore if you want to change the packages your app service has access to, you must update `requirements.txt`.
